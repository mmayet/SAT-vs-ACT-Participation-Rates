# Exploring Standardized Testing Participation

Given SAT and ACT data for the 2017 testing year, I was tasked to advise the College Board to increase SAT partitication.

As always, I started with basic data cleaning and EDA. Aside from one off number, and a few basic type changes, the data was quite adept to being done analysis on. However, the issue arose when using this data to actually change policy in the coming years. Mainly because there has been a lot of jumping back and forth between a few states in regards to whether they make the SAT mandatory on highschool juniors or not.As well as future changes that are coming to the SAT in the coming years by aligning better with Common Core standards.

Regardless, we can still make an attempt to adivse the College Board to increase SAT participation. This is because, 60% of states have a higher ACT participation rate than SAT. So how does the College Board increase particiaption? There are already 17 states that have the ACT as a mandatory test, and 17 that have the SAT as a mandatory test. 3 states that make it mandatory to choose one or the other.

The key point here is that 4 states are offered free SAT's and in those 4 states, SAT participation is extremley high. Looking at that, it's advisable that the College Board targets states that don't have a mandatory test, and push free tests to increase participation.
